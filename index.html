    Hi, I'm Ekaterina Blagoeva! I grew up in a small northwestern town of Bulgaria. Growing up I was always interested in computers, game systems and etc.
    My father is a technician and I've spent many days watching him repair printers, phones, computers and so on. I wanted to become like him, but with a little difference, I wanted to know how to be able to build and repair the software, instead of the hardware.

    <br>
    In highschool my curriculum was focused on IT, where I was able to gain basic computer software understanding. In college I majored in Computer Science, where I obtained basic programming skills.
    <br>
    <br>
    Moving to America set everything behind, since I was trying to build a life from scratch in a foreign country. After being here for almost 7 years and settled I am ready to pursue my career as a web developer.
